# kushi-css

This is an experimental sandbox repo intended for the early development of
Kushi's new v1 css transpilation pipeline and build system. The code here will
most likely be folded into the main kushi repo</a>.

Check out
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kushidesign/kushi-css/blob/main/doc/towards-kushi-v1.md">this doc</a>
for design and usage info around the set of public macros and fns being developed
in this repo.

Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kushidesign/kushi-css/blob/main/doc/towards-kushi-v1.md">Clojurists Together</a> for their generous support of this project during the 2024 Q3 funding cycle.
